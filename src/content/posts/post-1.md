Much of human history is contextualized by the larger scale conflicts that were happening at the time. Its nice to imagine that this came out of some singular moment in some pre-written ancient history, that our propensity to violence is something that was discovered. The reality of the situation is that the violence we find core to our shared story of our species is that it existed before humans ever did. Animals fight, with full scale wars happening between insect clans, struggles for territory and the survival of your grouping is something innate in many creatures.

We know this to be true, that the violence we cannot seem to escape from is something deep rooted, something we cannot easily get away from. It takes one small thing on the wrong day for anyone to be unable to fight the instinctual reaction to violence. In the ways that humans do, we've spent a large amount of our time and effort to quote unquote "evolve" past our animalistic tendencies. When considering violence, it is easy to feel as though we are getting to the point where it can be an issue of the past. In the global north there has been an "unprecedented" period of peace, a narrative only recently cracked by the provocations of Putin. If the "developed" world is close to evolving past violence, why does it still always seem so precarious, waiting for one wrong move by one powerful person to give up the whole charade?

The growing influence of the writings of [[Patrick Deneen]] has been quiet, but not for his lack of effort. His thoughts on postliberalism were originally contextualized in a leftist manner, as a rebellion against the system propping up global capitalism. The liberal democracies that have dominated the world since WW2 have been seen to be rotting from the inside out, and worse, unable to stop the rot. The bureaucracy was too large and encumbered to change anything, the "voted in" politicians were too addicted to the power, and the ever present commodification of ever increasing parts of life seemed to create an endless cycle that would death spiral to the very end.
