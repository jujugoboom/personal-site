tmMuch of human history is contextualized by the larger scale conflicts that were happening at the time. Its nice to imagine that this came out of some singular moment in some pre-written ancient history, that our propensity to violence is something that was discovered. The reality of the situation is that the violence we find core to our shared story of our species is that it existed before humans ever did. Animals fight, with full scale wars happening between insect clans, struggles for territory and the survival of your grouping is something innate in many creatures.

We know this to be true, that the violence we cannot seem to escape from is something deep rooted, something we cannot easily get away from. It takes one small thing on the wrong day for anyone to be unable to fight the instinctual reaction to violence. In the ways that humans do, we've spent a large amount of our time and effort to quote unquote "evolve" past our animalistic tendencies. When considering violence, it is easy to feel as though we are getting to the point where it can be an issue of the past. In the global north there has been an "unprecedented" period of peace, a narrative only recently cracked by the provocations of Putin. If the "developed" world is close to evolving past violence, why does it still always seem so precarious, waiting for one wrong move by one powerful person to give up the whole charade?

The growing influence of the writings of [Patrick Deneen] has been quiet, but not for his lack of effort. His thoughts on postliberalism were originally contextualized in a leftist manner, as a rebellion against the system propping up global capitalism. The liberal democracies that have dominated the world since WW2 have been seen to be rotting from the inside out, and worse, unable to stop the rot. The bureaucracy was too large and encumbered to change anything, the "voted in" politicians were too addicted to the power, and the ever present commodification of ever increasing parts of life seemed to create an endless cycle that would death spiral to the very end.

While some on the left, including notable figures such as Barack Obama, gave kudos to [Patrick] for his observations of the failings of modern liberal democracies, but critiqued his lack of solutions and overall ambiguity around any proposed alternatives. After several years of trying, and with gradual changes to his political views, [Patrick] found an audience on the american right. 

In a perfect brew of timing and overall social climate, a growing extreme right in america needing a shared set of political ideals to build off of, and [Patrick]'s growing personal extremism, matched to help each other grow. By gaining the backing of the larger american right, [Patrick] found the validation he had been craving for years. The right also found a stable foundation to build its thoughts off of, using the framework of postliberalism to posit each pundits personal agenda. Though this, people like [Elon Musk] found footing for his techno-feudalist ideals, as well as the cover needed to do it under the guise of a greater mission to mars.

This is where I have to say, [Patrick] is right. Liberal democracy has always been a system that was going to die its slow death, much like the systems it ultimately replaced. Once the rulers no longer had the divine will of god to back them, they had to find a new reason why they had to be the ones on top. Under liberal democracies this became a combination of "democratic will" and money, both of which are unassailable structures in our society. 

Until this point, I've been conflating capitalism with liberal democracy. Mostly because they are somewhat inseparable, but only in one way. Someone may say, but when we had kings we also had rich, landed nobility. And while the power of this nobility generally was thought to have descended from the king, it is more realistically a reflection of the money of the individual or their inheritance. While most people today would point and say its another form of capitalism, I think that would stretch the terminology too far, as most of the nobility only were able to keep their money and power under lease from the king.

So it seems that the money itself is the abstraction of power, and this would make sense with a historical eye. Julius Ceasar may have been a great general, but it was his ability to gain and use money for loyalty and power that made him historic. Wars throughout written european history tend to fall to the gain of money and other money-making resources. This all brings the question of what money even is. While ostensively its nothing more than some abstract representation of value, there is some instinctual understanding that it is something more than that. 

To avoid taking to much of a Focultian stance on the subject, I find its hard to argue that most, if not all, power in the world is taken through violence. You can have leaders, coordinators, people that are decision makers, but to become a ruler takes violence. To rule and be a ruler is to remove the free will of another and make them submit to you, a fairly pure form of violence. While some may "give this willingly", it seems to me that no one in their right mind would submit themselves to that unless there are other external forces. This is corroborated by our modern world's abhorrence at slavery, with an understanding that even though someone may put themselves in a slave position, it would only happen under what they view as being much worse circumstances. For circumstances to reach the point where loss of free will is preferable, there must be much greater violent forces in the world.
