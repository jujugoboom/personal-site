From his wikipedia "Patrick J. Deneen (born 1964) is an American political theorist and author, known for his critical examination of liberalism and its effect on contemporary society. He is a professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, where his work emphasizes the interrelations of political philosophy, culture, and religion."[^1]

In the 21st century Patrick Deneen has become a large figure in political science. He originally brought his thoughts to the left of the political spectrum. His book "Why Liberalism Failed"[^2] laid out his thoughts around the failings of liberal democracies. It explores how both libertarianism and liberalism has failed us all, saying "we should rightly wonder whether America is not in the early days of its eternal life but rather approaching the end of the natural cycle of corruption and decay that limits the lifespan of all human creations"[^3]

After failing to find traction for his ideas on the left, or some would argue through a gradual change in his politics, Patrick found success with the American right in picking up his ideas of postliberalism. A combination of a sound critique of the liberal bureaucracy and persistent vagueness in his proposed solutions allowed a large coalition of right-wing ideas to form. Many contemporary conservative figures would fall under this umbrella of thought, but the main ones post-2024 election seem to be JD Vance, VP pick for [Donald Trump] and [Elon Musk].
