Hi, my name is Justin

I'm a fullstack engineer who has had a long-lasting love of technology
and computers

I've watched as the things I love have been rotted from the inside out
by corporate interests and never ending profit

This is my personal site, where I write whatever I feel like. Nothing
here comes from anyone but myself, and I make no promises about the
content

It may include ramblings, musings, and other various writings

If you feel so strongly, you can email me at <me@justincovell.net>
